This plugin also allows you to create personalised templates for logged in users or email recipients. By the use of placeholders based on wordpress user data. The following data is supported: %user_login% - the users username, %user_email% - the users email, %first_name% - the users first name, %last_name% - the users last name, %display_name% - the users display name, %ID% - the users ID, %description% - the users bio or description.

Examples:

*  [lh_personalised_content]%display_name%[/lh_personalised_content]     will display display name to logged in users and nothing to logged out users
*  [lh_personalised_content loggedout="Hello guest"]%first_name%[/lh_personalised_content] will display the users first name to logged in users and "hello guest" to logged out users
